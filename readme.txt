# Dimension WordPress Template

## Description
Dimension is a responsive HTML5 template by HTML5 UP, converted into a WordPress theme. This template is suitable for personal and commercial use, providing a clean and modern design with a focus on simplicity and usability.

## Features
- Responsive design
- Customizable header and footer
- AJAX-based article loading
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Installation
1. **Download the Theme**: Download the theme files from the repository or the provided link.
2. **Upload to WordPress**:
   - Go to your WordPress admin dashboard.
   - Navigate to `Appearance > Themes`.
   - Click on `Add New` and then `Upload Theme`.
   - Choose the downloaded ZIP file and click `Install Now`.
3. **Activate the Theme**: Once installed, click `Activate` to activate the theme.

## Usage
- **Customizing Header and Footer**: You can customize the header and footer by editing the respective template files (`header.php` and `footer.php`).
- **Adding Font Awesome Icons**: Since the Font Awesome feature isn't fully integrated, you will need to use HTML to add icons manually. Use the following format to add Font Awesome icons to your pages:
  ```html
  <ul class="icons">
    <li>
      <a href="#" class="icon brands fa-facebook"><span class="label">Facebook</span></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
- **Creating Articles**: Create new pages in the WordPress admin area. The template will automatically handle the display and AJAX loading of articles.
- **Menu Setup**: Set up your navigation menu by going to `Appearance > Menus` and creating a new menu. Assign it to the `Primary Menu` location. You can assign pages to the menu to be able to view the article modals.

## Dependencies
- **jQuery**: Ensure jQuery is loaded in your WordPress site.
- **Font Awesome**: The template uses Font Awesome for icons. Make sure it is enqueued in your theme.
